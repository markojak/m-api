I'm a Product Leader with over a decade of experience in Seed/Series A startups building fast-growing products.

If you have a clear business vision but are lacking this to be translated into effective product and growth strategy this is where I can help

I founded a B2B SaaS Machine Learning startup (exit 2017) and an online Marketplace in HR tech. Recently I ran Growth and Product for a D2C Pharmaceutical company managing product and go to market where we achieved 6.5x growth in 2 years and advised a direct to consumer healthcare company define their product and growth strategy.

I help early founders to focus on their highest leverage customers and figure out the things that work and those who are post Product-Market Fit to expand their feature and territory strategy.

"Mediocre products try to manufacture customer motivation. Instead, we should carefully figure out our customers’ innate motivations, then offer cmd as the least risky outlet for their most intense motivation by reducing friction, amplifying satisfaction, or creating identity"

Some things I've worked on that might be worth mentioning

░░░░ Product Strategy for Clear.bio ░░░░
Clear.bio is a solution to help people with Diabetes reverse their disease through healthy lifestyle choices. I defined the product vision and roadmap using qual+quant user insights to develop their customer segmentation and product positioning.

░░░░ Growth Loops for Everyone.org ░░░░
Everyone.org helps patients import recently approved medicines for severe diseases like Cancer. Identified and scaled SEO and Email Marketing channels to 30x traffic and improve net revenue retention. Developed their customer data platform and implemented an experimentation and quantitative structure for decision making.

░░░░ SpO2 Glucose Monitoring (Project) ░░░░
High precision in vivo quantification of peripheral glucose flux, using multispectral detection and a supervised, non-parametric machine learning framework. We attempted to use a pulse oximeter's spectroscopic signal (660nm and 940nm) but this was abandoned due to a lack of precision and recall. Detection of glucose is very different from mARD levels required for precision and recall.

░░░░ Scaling Unstructured Text Processing (Overscore) ░░░░
Had fun building a text processing engine that could process large amounts of unstructured text such as found in Resume's. Technically challenging in building this in a scalable manner using K8, Docker, Tika, Word2Vec and Gensim libraries customized for unsupervised machine learning.

░░░░ P2P Job Referral Platform ░░░░
Back in 2015 when the social graphs were more open we built a mobile application that enabled people to connect their Facebook and LinkedIn connections and then refer them to jobs on our platform. Repeating organic behavior at scale is a difficult task and monetary compensation is only one part of this.
