I take pre-Series A companies from Zero to One. I do this by translating what it takes to grow for the team. This means aligning Product, Market and the Business model to get compounding growth. 

I founded a B2B SaaS Machine Learning API startup (exit 2017) and an online Marketplace in HR tech (shutdown in 2019). Recently I ran Growth and Product for a D2C Pharmaceutical company managing product and go to market where we achieved 6.5x growth in 2 years. 

I help early founders to focus on their highest leverage market and figure out the things that work and those who are post PMF to help the business to continue to grow like crazy. 

"Mediocre products try to manufacture customer motivation. Instead, we should carefully figure out our customers’ innate motivations, then offer cmd as the least risky outlet for their most intense motivation by reducing friction, amplifying satisfaction, or creating identity"

Some things I had fun working on

░░░░ Document sharing for web3 (cmd.xyz) ░░░░
Stack: Next.js, rainbowui-kit (alpha) + wagmi hooks, Supabase, Prisma, Puppeteer

░░░░ SpO2 Glucose Monitoring ░░░░
High precision in vivo quantification of peripheral glucose flux, using multispectral detection and a supervised, non-parametric machine learning framework. We attempted to use a pulse oximeter's spectroscopic signal (660nm and 940nm)
This failed 

- Unless a spectroscophic technique can see and accurate 

░░░░ Scaling Unstructured Text Processing (2016) ░░░░
Had fun building
