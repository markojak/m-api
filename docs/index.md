██ ＰＲＯＪＥＣＴＳ 
Some things I had fun working on. A combination of Product + Growth. 

░░ Document sharing for web3 (cmd.xyz) ░░
Stack: Next.js, rainbowui-kit (alpha) + wagmi hooks, Supabase, Prisma, Puppeteer

░░ SpO2 Glucose Monitoring ░░
High precision in vivo quantification of peripheral glucose flux, using multispectral detection and a supervised, non-parametric machine learning framework. We attempted to use a pulse oximeter's spectroscopic signal (660nm and 940nm)
This failed 

- Unless a spectroscophic technique can see and accurate

Had fun building

██ ＡＢＯＵＴ 
I take pre-Series A companies from Zero to One. This means figuring out Product, Market and Business model and aligning these to compound growth. My core strengths are Product and building Growth Loops (AAR) 

2x Founder in B2B SaaS Machine Learning API + Online Marketplace with one acquisition. Recently a Chief Growth Officer for a D2C healthcare company growing 10x in < 2years. 

I am biased towards action and I love building technology products but I also believe what you don't build is more important than what you do. I thrive in high pressure enviroments with ambitious objectives, limited resources and highly intelligent and driven people.
